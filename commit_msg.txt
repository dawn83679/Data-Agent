refactor(ai-chat): decouple interactive tool rendering and enhance MLLM prompts

Frontend:
- Removed global modal states (askQuestionModalStore, writeConfirmModalStore) and legacy popup components (AskUserQuestionDialog, ChatInputQuestion, etc.).
- Refactored ToolRunBlock to render interactive tools (AskUserQuestionCard, WriteConfirmCard) directly inline inside the chat message flow.
- Filtered out completed/cancelled interactive cards from rendering in historical chat streams to keep the UI clean.
- Updated i18n locales (zh.json, en.json) to submit highly structured Markdown payloads (including contextual original questions and SQL previews) when responding to the agent, vastly improving prompt accuracy.

Backend:
- Simplified WriteConfirmationStore.java implementation by safely removing convoluted synchronized mechanisms and flattening logical validation checks.
- Enforced strict constraints inside system prompts (system_zh.xml, system_en.xml) requiring the LLM to exclusively use the askUserQuestion tool for inquiries instead of plain text.

This significantly improves the developer experience, perceived UI performance, and long-term LLM prompt retention context.
